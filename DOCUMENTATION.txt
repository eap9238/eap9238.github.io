Project: Book Finder
Student: Eleanor Post

Current project state: COMPLETE
Current APIs used: Google Books API (search version and viewer 
initalization and embed version), Google Maps API, Google 
Locations API, WorldCAT search API (through HTTPS gate)


How to use:
You enter a search term into the box at the top of the screen 
and can select a search field to specify into, and then select 
the search button. 

This will bring up a list of boxes containing search information. 
You can click on the buttons below the a box and it will slide you to a viewer that displays 
exerpts from the book or to the library search. You can scroll through it and read from it, 
and use the buyer links on it, or you can select find a library. 
That will pull up the ISBN number of the book, and load that to 
the screen, which looks like the book search API, but only has 
buttons that indicate locations for libraries. Select the find it
button and a map will open to show a route from your current 
location to the Rochester Public Library. The library tab has
a search box to reset the start locations. Each step has a button 
that will return you to the first view to pick/search for a new 
book. 

the google lcations API is used to limit use of html popups requesting permissions.
