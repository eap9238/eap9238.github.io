Project: Book Finder
Student: Eleanor Post

Current project state: Prototype
Current APIs used: Google Books API (search version and viewer 
initalization and embed version), Google Maps API
APIs planned to implement: WorldCAT search API

How to use:
You enter a search term into the box at the top of the screen 
(this will later allow you to select which fields this searches, 
for now it does all of them), and then select the search button. 
This will bring up a list of boxes containing search information. 
You click on a box and it will slide you to a viewer that displays 
exerpts from the book. You can scroll through it and read from it, 
and use the buyer links on it, or you can select find a library. 
That will pull up the ISBN number of the book, and load that to 
the screen (this will be used to search worldCAT). For now, an 
override button exists to bypass selecting a library. Select the 
debug button and a map will open to show a route from your current 
location to the Rochester Public Library. Each step has a button 
that will return you to the first view to pick/search for a new 
book. 

Current formatting is limited at best. This will be improved in the 
final iteration.
